# Learn TypeScript

This repository documents my journey learning TypeScript.  
It includes notes, example code, and small projects as I explore the language — starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving into more advanced topics.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- TypeScript basics (types, functions, interfaces, etc.)
- Object-oriented programming
- Generics
- Modules and namespaces
- TypeScript with React/Node.js (coming soon)

## 🛠️ How to Use
Feel free to browse the code and notes. If you're learning too, clone the repo and follow along!
